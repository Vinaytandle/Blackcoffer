The project leverages the MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, to create a robust and scalable data visualization dashboard using the given data. MongoDB serves as the database to store and manage the provided JSON data. Express.js and Node.js are used to create a backend API that fetches data from the MongoDB database. React is utilized to develop the front-end of the dashboard, enabling the creation of interactive and dynamic visualizations using libraries such as D3.js, Chart.js, and Plotly.js. This combination of technologies ensures a seamless and efficient user experience, allowing for real-time data interaction and insightful visual representation.
